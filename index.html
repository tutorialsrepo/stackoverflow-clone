            Stack Overflow for Teams has been a resource for our entire company.
            Not only for developers to solve problems, it’s also enabled our
            sales field to answer technical questions that help them close
            deals.

            Engineers should help solve the hardest questions, the unknowns,
            where being familiar with how the product was built is essential.
            But we don’t want to keep answering solved problems over and over
            again. That’s where Stack Overflow for Teams really helps.

            As we started to use [Stack Overflow for Teams] and saw how nice it
            was to have a repository of information, we started to see it spread
            to other teams. Our customer support team started using it, our
            people success team started using it, next thing we knew, we had
            [Slack] integrations all over the place.
